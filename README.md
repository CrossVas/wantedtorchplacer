# What does this mod do?

This mod brings back my favorite feature from IC2 for MC 1.6.4 - 1.7.10 versions. Now you place torches in the world as long as you have them in your inventory by simply right-clicking on a block with supported tools (see below). 

# Support:

- IndustrialCraft 2: Mining Drill, Diamond Drill, Iridium Drill, Bronze Pickaxe;
- Thermal Foundation: Pickaxes, Hammers, Excavators;
- Thermal Innovations: Fluxbores;
- Redstone Arsenal: Fluxed Pickaxe, Fluxed Hammer, Fluxed Excavator (and also Redstone Repository Revolved should work, too);
- Minecraft: Pickaxes.

# Plans:

Mekanism support (not sure about Mekanism support for Atomic Disassembler, but once I test all the stuff I added, it will be easy enough to add this to the supported tools list)

# State:

Currently this mod is mostly complete as I added all the support I wanted, so now I'll test it and improve the code.

# Credits:

IC2 Team for the idea;
